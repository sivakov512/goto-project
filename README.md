Configuration and usage
-----
Specify your project in `~/.goto-project.yaml` file.

``` yaml
goto-project:  # this is a project name
  path: ~/Devel/Projects/goto-project/  # path project
  instructions:  # any instructions to call when you switch project
    - source ~/Devel/Envs/py3_goto-project/bin/activate
  command: vim  # command to run when project opened
  clear_on_exit: false  # if specified as false then terminal output will not be cleared on project close
```

To list all available projects call

``` shell
gt
```

To open project call `gt` with project name as argument

``` shell
gt goto-project
```

To close project press `C-D`. When you close project all changes will be breaked. For example, `$PATH` will be restored if you extend it.

Usage example
-------
For example you have a project named `awesome-nuxt-blog` placed at `~/Projects/awesome-nuxt-blog`.
You need to extend your `$PATH` with `.mode_modules/.bin`, source `.env/bin/activate` and show git status when project opened.

Create `~/.goto-project.yaml` with this content:
``` yaml
awesome-nuxt-blog:
  path: ~/Projects/awesome-nuxt-blog
  instructions:
    - source .env/bin/activate
    - export PATH=".node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    - git status
```

Now you at `~/`. Type `gt awesome-nuxt-blog`. Now you at `~/Projects/awesome-nuxt-blog`.

All your instructions are executed. Also you see `git status` output in your shell.

Type `C-D` and now you in `~/`.
